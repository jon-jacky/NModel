Web pages about NModel model-based testing tools.

These pages were made by Jonathan Jacky in 2007 - 2008.  They are
archived here for personal and historic interest.

The original NModel web site, including these pages but also all the
NModel source code, was hosted at CodePlex, which was operated by
Microsoft.  Microsoft shut down CodePlex in 2015, and CodePlex users
were encouraged to migrate their sites to Github.  I did not migrate
the site at that time, but I did get a zip file of the site contents.

Only now (Oct 2022) am I restoring the NModel web pages only, to this
repository.  These pages, which I wrote, document NModel.  I am not
including the NModel source code files here -- I did not write most of
them.  The NModel source code files are in another Github repository:
https://github.com/juhan/NModel That repository does not include my
web pages.

The license.json in this repository is copied from the zipped archive
from the Codeplex site.
