<div class="wikidoc">The <b>NModel Library</b> provides attributes and data types for writing <a href="https://nmodel.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Model%20Programs&referringTitle=NModel%20Library">model programs</a> in C#.<br /><br />The library is most thoroughly documented in the online help that is included when you <a href="https://nmodel.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Installing%20NModel&referringTitle=NModel%20Library">install NModel</a>.   <br />To access the online help:  <i>Start Menu -&gt; All programs -&gt; NModel -&gt; NModel documentation</i><br /><br />The library is also documented in this <a href="http://staff.washington.edu/jon/modeling-book/nmodel-reference.pdf">NModel Reference</a> (45-page PDF document).<br /><br />Model programs must use the library data types for collections and objects, not the usual C# and .NET data types.<br /><br />Some of the attributes in the library are:
<ul><li><span class="codeInline">[Action]</span>, a method which is an <i>action</i> (state transition) of a model program.</li>
<li><span class="codeInline">[AcceptingStateCondition]</span>, a Boolean method, property, or field that is true in all <i>accepting states</i> where runs of a model program are allowed to stop.</li>
<li><span class="codeInline">[Domain(&quot;name&quot;)]</span>, applied to an action parameter, where <i>name</i> identifies the set of values to be assigned to that parameter during <i>exploration</i> of a model program.  Used to finitize exploration.</li>
<li><span class="codeInline">[StateFilter]</span>, a Boolean method, property, or field which must be true in all states that are included in the <i>finite state machine</i> generated by <i>exploration</i> of a model program. Used to finitize exploration.</li>
<li><span class="codeInline">[StateInvariant]</span>, a Boolean method, property, or field that must be true in every state.  Failure of the state invariant in any state indicates a modeling error.</li>
<li><span class="codeInline">[Feature]</span>, a class which is a <i>feature</i>, a collection of related state variables and actions that can optionally be included in a model program.</li>
<li><span class="codeInline">[Requirement(&quot;text&quot;)]</span>, applied to any attributable element, can document the relation between a model program and a natural language document.  A tool can monitor requirements coverage, or print the text when a test fails or an invariant is violated.</li></ul>
Some of these attributes can take additional arguments not shown here, consult the documentation.  The documentation describes more attributes as well.<br /><br />Some of the data types in the library are:
<ul><li><span class="codeInline">CompoundValue</span>, a value type similar to a C# <span class="codeInline">struct</span>, but may also implement tree structures.  Base type for the following collection types.</li>
<li><span class="codeInline">Set</span>, an unordered collection of distinct values.</li>
<li><span class="codeInline">Map</span>, a finite mapping of keys to values.</li>
<li><span class="codeInline">Sequence</span>, an ordered collection of (possibly repeating) values.</li>
<li><span class="codeInline">Bag</span>, an unordered collection of possibly repeating values, also called a <i>multiset</i>.</li>
<li><span class="codeInline">ValueArray</span>, an immutable type that provides structural equality for arrays.</li>
<li><span class="codeInline">LabeledInstance</span>, base class for types with instance fields as state variables.</li></ul>
Collections in model programs must belong to the library collection types <span class="codeInline">Set</span> etc., not the usual .NET collection types such as <span class="codeInline">array</span>, <span class="codeInline">ArrayList</span>, or <span class="codeInline">Dictionary</span>.<br /><br />The library collection types all behave as <i>value types</i>.  They use <i>structural equality</i> and they are <i>immutable</i>, so you must code <span class="codeInline">s = s.Add(x)</span>, not just <span class="codeInline">s.Add(x)</span>.<br /><br />For object-oriented modeling, where instance fields are used as state variables, classes in model programs must be derived from the library class type <span class="codeInline">LabeledInstance</span>, not just <span class="codeInline">object</span>.</div><div class="ClearBoth"></div>
